# staticdata.cpp

A simple C++ program demonstrating the use of static data members within a class.

## Description

showcases how static data members work in C++. The program defines a `car` class that includes a static member variable to count the number of objects created. Each time a `car` object is instantiated, the static member is incremented. The program also accepts user input for car details and displays them.

## Features

- Demonstrates static data members in C++
- Counts the number of objects created from the class
- Accepts and displays car details using member functions
